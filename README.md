 1581-TOOLS
============

A small tool addressing the most common functions required when using a
1581 disk drive on a C64. These are:

- creation of subdirectories
- error scan
- sector editor
- undelete by analysing block linkers
- freeing 20 blocks by moving data into the second half of the directory

This source code has been migrated from a self-hosted "Professional-Ass"
to the ca65 of the [cc65](https://cc65.github.io/) package.
